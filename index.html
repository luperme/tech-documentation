        <p>Congratulations on becoming a JMU Duke! While this page is directed towards incoming freshmen, returning students are welcome, because going through the enrollment process can always be a little daunting. But no worries, this walkthrough is fit with screenshots from MyMadison so you'll know exactly where to go!</p>

        <p>Assuming you've activated your e-ID (if you haven't, stop here and go to <a href="accounts.jmu.edu">accounts.jmu.edu</a>), you'll first need to get to the MyMadison welcome screen and enter your new e-ID and password. Logging in will take you to a screen similar to this:</p>
        <img id="first" src="https://preview.ibb.co/hqbFrU/2018_08_08_15_38_27_Window.png"/>
        <p>If you look at the tabs across the top, you'll see one labeled <code>Student</code>. Click this tab to be taken to your Student Dashboard. Then go towards the center of the page to the module labeled "Student Center". Click the blue hyperlink with the same name to continue.</p>

        <img id="second" src="https://image.ibb.co/fYDvrU/2018_08_08_15_39_48_Window.png"/>
        <p>The image above should be the top of the page you see when clicking the Student Center. We'll be staying within the "Academics" section of the page for the purposes of enrollment. This will also be your destination to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>check your final grades</li>
          <li>request an official transcript</li>
          <li>send an email to your advisor</li>
          <li> any errand relating to your academic life at JMU!
        </ul>
        <p>Click the <code>Search</code> link at the top left of the Academics module to search for your first class!</p>
        <p>Now that you're finally ready to search, enter the code of the class you're looking for (ex. BIO 101) into the corresponding boxes, Subject and Course Number, and press "Search". Depending on the time of the semester, this search might need to be modified to find an available seat- classes with waitlists won't appear unless you uncheck the "Show Open Classes Only" box, or a class offered exclusively in the spring semester won't appear without the Term dropdown menu being changed.</p>
        <img id="third" src="https://image.ibb.co/fBqKJ9/2018_08_08_15_40_19_Window.png"/>
        <p>Below is an example of a results page from your search. If for any reason an aspect of the available classes (i.e. day/time, professor, location) is not cooperative with the rest of your schedule, navigate to the bottom of the results and press "New Search" or "Modify Search" to find an alternative for that class. Otherwise, press "Select" and confirm your choice to place the class in your enrollment shopping cart!</p>

      <article>
        <p>Your enrollment shopping cart is where you'll keep all of your potential classes for the upcoming term. While the example below is of an empty cart, yours should contain the class you selected in the section prior. Next to the class, there is a checkbox for deletion of the course or simply to select it. Select the class and press "Add" at the bottom of your shopping cart, then confirm to officially enroll in your first class!</p>

        <p>By now you should have noticed the tabs at the top of your window (seen above). We've already explored the <code>Search</code> and <code>Plan</code> tabs in the previous sections, so let's move on to <code>Enroll</code>. The first tab <code>Add</code> is essentially adding from your shopping cart. The <code>Drop</code> and <code>Swap</code> tabs are useful when you have a schedule but between trying to take classes with friends and making time for lunch, you realize you need to adjust it. The page for dropping classes has identical rules for adding classes, so refer back to the Enrollment Shopping Cart section. Swapping classes will take you to a page like this: </p>
        <img id="seventh" src="https://image.ibb.co/cPAKJ9/2018_08_08_15_44_24_Window.png"/>
        <p>Selecting a class to replace your first one is much easier if you have already added it to your shopping cart, so make sure to do that before attempting to swap a class. <em>Note: If you change your mind and want the first class back, act fast so that you reclaim it while it's still available!</em> Now let's take a look at your final schedule.</p>

    <section id="Viewing_Your_Schedule" class="main-section">
      <header id="sechead">Viewing Your Schedule</header>
      <article>
        <p>To take a look at your work, navigate to the <code>Enroll</code> tab and select <code>My Class Schedule</code>. The "list view" is useful for when it's time to purchase books, while the "weekly calendar view" is best for visualizing what the semester will look like.</p>
        <img id="eighth" src="https://preview.ibb.co/iEhYd9/2018_08_08_15_46_18_Window.png"/>
        <p><em>Note: The above schedule is solely an example.</em> This default view of the week displays class code, day/time, and location, but below the calendar is a set of checkboxes that toggle:
        <ul>
          <li>Instructor</li>
          <li>Full name of the course</li>
          <li>Times past the 8:00pm cutoff</li>
        </ul>
        If your schedule is blank, check that the week chosen at the top of the calendar is one occurring during the semester.
        </p>
